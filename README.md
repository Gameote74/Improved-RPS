# Improved-RPS
1. During the summer of 2024 (July-August) I was tasked with making a function for Rock Paper Scissors and was allowed to make any other adjustments that I want to it.
   
2. I took big inspiration from the Big Bang Theory and added a Lizard and Spock, leading to 5 choices instead of 3

# Rules (Who beats who)
1. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock
   
2. Spock beats both Scissors and Rock
   
3. Lizard beats both Paper and Spock
   
4. Paper and Lizard beat Spock
   
5. Rock and Scissors beat Paper
   
6. Nothing happens if there's a tie 

   In the end, each sign is supposed to beat 2 other types compared to just 1
